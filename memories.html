    <h1>22 of My Favorite Memories</h1>

    <p>
        1. Remember when we started talking again after you were ignoring me and giving me the cold shoulder? You were playing hard to get, huh? But hey, you're totally worth the wait.
        <br><br>
        2. The first time we met and talked like we were the only two people in the world. Honestly, that moment felt so special to me. I couldn’t stop smiling.
        <br><br>
        3. Remember when I brought you lumpia? It was totally overcooked, but you still ate it all like it was gourmet food, even though you almost choked waiting for me to offer you a drink. Haha, I’ll never forget that.
        <br><br>
        4. Our first trip from San Joaquin to Calbayog. I loved that ride! It was also the first time you hugged me from behind, and I didn’t want that moment to end.
        <br><br>
        5. The day you said yes to being my girlfriend. It was so perfect. We were at the beach, the sunset was beautiful, and everything just felt right.
        <br><br>
        6. The very first time I felt your lips on mine. It was like the whole world stood still. That’s still one of my favorite memories.
        <br><br>
        7. Watching Kdramas together, all snuggled up. Those moments are just pure happiness for me.
        <br><br>
        8. Watching One Piece with you, even though you’re not a fan. You still gave it a shot for me, and that just shows how amazing and supportive you are.
        <br><br>
        9. Seeing you buy your own iPhone with all the hard work you put in. Honestly, I’m so proud of you, love. You’re crushing it!
        <br><br>
        10. When you helped me dress better and dragged me to the ukay-ukay to shop. I never thought I’d be thankful for secondhand clothes, but you made it fun.
        <br><br>
        11. You put so much effort into making my birthday special, and even got mad at me for not getting excited enough. Haha, I loved how you cared so much.
        <br><br>
        12.That night we had ice cream because I was so drunk and needed to sober up. You gave me the best “good-natured” nagging, and honestly, you kept me in check.
        <br><br>
        13. That time I couldn’t light the charcoal and we were starving. Instead of getting mad, you joked about it, and we ended up having the best grill session anyway.
        <br><br>
        14. The first time I took you to my house. I saw you shaking a bit when you greeted my parents. It was so cute, and I couldn’t stop thinking how lucky I was.
        <br><br>
        15. When we went grocery shopping and checked every price to stay within budget. It’s moments like that that make me love you even more. We make such a great team.
        <br><br>
        16.That time you were brave enough to bring me to your place. I was a nervous wreck, but you made me feel so comfortable, like I was already part of your family.
        <br><br>
        17. When you cooked rice for me and even washed the dishes after. That’s real “wifey material,” and I’m here for it.
        <br><br>
        18. Riding my dream scooter with you and getting caught in the rain. It was a little crazy, but we laughed through it, and it was one of the best memories.
        <br><br>
        19. Our monthsary at McDo. You nearly finished the entire 1.5L of Coke, and I couldn’t stop laughing. You made the day extra special in the funniest way.
        <br><br>
        20. Remember when we were playing billiards, and my plan was to show off, but it turned out you were better at it? We literally made that one match last for an hour! Hahaha!
        <br><br>
        21. That time we went on the Viking ride — I was absolutely terrified, and I almost fainted from fear. I was so scared of the ride that I completely forgot you were by my side, but somehow, you kept me calm.
        <br><br>
        22. And the Ferris wheel — I thought I was going to pass out from the height, but I completely forgot I wasn’t alone because I was so freaked out. But you were right there, holding my hand, making everything feel a little less scary.
        <br><br>
        There are so many more... I'll just wait until you turn 1,000 years old so I can list them all!
